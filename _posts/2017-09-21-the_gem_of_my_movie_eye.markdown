Completing the CLI Gem project helped me accomplish two firsts in my life, one being the obvious one of creating a ruby gem and the other was creating a blog. I just wanted to note that interesting fact and get it out of the way since it was a big deal for me haha.

As for the coding the gem, it was much more difficult than I first thought it would be. Just the process of coming up what exactly I wanted the gem to do was a beating. Did I want it to ask this? Or did I want it to retrieve that? All that did cause me a little bit of a headache because I couldn't make up my mind. After I had stuck to what I wanted to create it was easy to start to code.

I decided to create a gem that would retrieve a list of upcoming movies from the IMDB.com. Once that list populated, the user will be able to read the description from the movie they selected just by letting the gem know which movie they were interested in from the list.

The whole process felt as if I was creating a clay statue. I say that because as I got closer to a finished product, I noticed that certain areas needed more work and others needed to be refined. There were also times were I didnâ€™t like certain parts and just had to start over from scratch.

I felt like I learned a lot from this project because it really just was put on me to go and make something. Although, the gem itself is pretty simple, I am very excited to see what else I will be able to create as I continue to learn.
